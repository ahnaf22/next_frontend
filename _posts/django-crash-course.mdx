2. [Queues](#queue)

An array is a random access data structure, where each element can be accessed directly and in constant time. A typical illustration of random access is a book -
each page of the book can be open independently of others.
Random access is critical to many algorithms, for example binary search. In this blog we are going to talk about a
subcase of sequential data structures, so called limited access data structures.

Stacks and Queues(pronounce as Kyoo) are an important Data Structure. Stacks and queues have lots of thing in common.
They are both linear data structures. The main difference between these two is how elements are inserted and removed from the Stacks or the
Queues.

Stacks work as LIFO - Last In First Out
Queues work as FIFO - First In First Out

# Stacks <a name="stack"></a>

A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed: push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack.
A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top.
push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top.
A helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books; you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.

Enough talk, now let's implement stacks. We will implement the following functions to our stack:

- **Peek** returns the top element
- **Pop** removes the top element
- **Push** insert element at the top
- **IsEmpty** returns true if stack is empty otherwise false
- **PrintStack** prints the value of the all the items from top to bottom

Let's see the building block of our stack. We will assume each element as a node and create stack with node elements.

The `Node` class consist of the value of the node and next is to hold the next element link. And for the `Stack` Class we need 3 things,

1. top element of the stack
2. last/bottom element of the stack
3. element number of the stack

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.top = null;
    this.bottom = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
}
```

`Peak` function returns the top element of the List. If the list is empty it will return null otherwise it will return the value of the top element.

```javascript
class Stack {
  // ...
  peek() {
    return this.top.value;
  }
}
```

`Push` function returns the entire node, after we add an element to the stack. This element will be at the top of the stack. First we initialize the node with the value, then we check if
stack is empty. If so, top and bottom both will be the newly created node because that's the only node we have. Otherwise, we replace the top node with the newNode and make the previous node as next of new top node.

```javascript
class Stack {
  // ...
  push(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (this.length === 0) {
      this.top = newNode;
      this.bottom = newNode;
    } else {
      const pointer = this.top;
      this.top = newNode;
      this.top.next = pointer;
    }
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }
}
```

`printStack` function is just a utility function that prints all the elements of the stack. It starts from the top node, and travarse the next until the last node.

```javascript
class Stack {
  // ...
  printStack() {
    console.log("==========");
    let current = this.top;
    while (current) {
      console.log(current.value);
      current = current.next;
    }
  }
}
```

`isEmpty` function returns true of there is no node in the stack otherwise returns false.

```javascript
class Stack {
  // ...
  isEmpty() {
    if (this.top) {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

Finally the full code.

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.top = null;
    this.bottom = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }

  peek() {
    return this.top.value;
  }

  push(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (this.length === 0) {
      this.top = newNode;
      this.bottom = newNode;
    } else {
      const pointer = this.top;
      this.top = newNode;
      this.top.next = pointer;
    }
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }
  pop() {
    if (!this.top) {
      return null;
    }

    this.top = this.top.next;
    this.length--;
    return this.top.value;
  }
  printStack() {
    console.log("==========");
    let current = this.top;
    while (current) {
      console.log(current.value);
      current = current.next;
    }
  }

  isEmpty() {
    if (this.top) {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
}

const stack = new Stack();
stack.push("Apple");
stack.push("Banana");
stack.push("Coconut");
stack.push("Date");

// console.log(stack.peek());
// console.log(stack.isEmpty());
// console.log(stack.pop());
// console.log(stack.length);
```

We can also implement stacks with arrays.

```javascript
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.array = [];
  }
  peek() {
    return this.array[this.array.length - 1];
  }
  push(value) {
    this.array.push(value);
    return this;
  }
  pop() {
    this.array.pop();
    return this;
  }
}
```

# Queues <a name="queue"></a>

A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.
An excellent example of a queue is a line of students in the food court.
New additions to a line made to the back of the queue, while removal (or serving) happens in the front.
In the queue only two operations are allowed enqueue and dequeue.
Enqueue means to insert an item into the back of the queue, dequeue means removing the front item.

The difference between stacks and queues is in removing.
In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

We will implement the following functions to our queues:

- **Peek** returns the top node
- **Enqueue** insert node at the end/last
- **Dequeue** removes node from the top

Similar to stack we will save the values in a Node.

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.first = null;
    this.last = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
}
```

As Queues works with the principle of FIFO so the first node will be considered as top.

```javascript
class Queue {
  //...
  peek() {
    return this.first;
  }
}
```

to `Enqueue` a node, we first check if there are any elements in the queue. If so, we create a new node with the value,
then exchange new node with the last node. If the queue was empty then both first and last node will be the new node.

```javascript
class Queue {
  //...
  enqueue(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (this.length === 0) {
      this.first = newNode;
      this.last = newNode;
    } else {
      this.last.next = newNode;
      this.last = newNode;
    }
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }
}
```

When `Dequeue` we check if there is any node existant, if not then we just return null. Otherwise, we remove the first node and make the next node of previous first node as first node.

```javascript
class Queue {
  //...
  dequeue() {
    if (!this.first) {
      return null;
    }
    let newNode = this.first.next;
    this.first = newNode;
    this.length--;

    return this;
  }
}
```

Here is the complete code.

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.first = null;
    this.last = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
  peek() {
    return this.first;
  }
  enqueue(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (this.length === 0) {
      this.first = newNode;
      this.last = newNode;
    } else {
      this.last.next = newNode;
      this.last = newNode;
    }
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }
  dequeue() {
    if (!this.first) {
      return null;
    }
    let newNode = this.first.next;
    this.first = newNode;
    this.length--;

    return this;
  }
}

const queue = new Queue();
queue.peek();
queue.enqueue("Apple");
queue.enqueue("Banana");
queue.enqueue("Coconut");
queue.peek();
queue.dequeue();
queue.dequeue();
queue.dequeue();
queue.peek();
```
